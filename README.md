An iOS app with widgets that display the results of pinging a Minecraft server. Both Bedrock and Java edition servers are supported.

Built on top of the [mcping](https://github.com/Scetch/mcping) crate.

## Note

**Development of this app has been stopped.** Apple rejected it from the App Store for "not having enough useful content", and I have no desire to bloat the app with unnecessary features beyond being an eye-catching, functional home screen widget for Minecraft servers. Additionally, I would have to pay Apple $99/year for the rest of my life to keep this app available for download, and I have no plans to monetize it in any way to recoup any of that cost.

Feel free to compile and run for yourself or fork the project. If you decide to fork the project and develop this to a point where you can get it onto the App Store, please take care to remove anything referencing me from the app. (I'd love to hear about it though! ðŸ˜„.)
